## About
One of my Semester-end projects.
It is like Snake Game in its functionality.

The focus of this project was to strictly adhere to my Professor's requirements.
So, don't expect a complete game.

Expect noob mistakes since it was before I even studied OOP properly.

## LSFML Instructions

I was required to use LSFML library
To compile the program, follow the instructions:

1-Open terminal in the folder.
2-Type "g++ main.cpp"
3-Type "g++ main.o -o app -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lsfml-audio" 
4-Type "./app"

That's it!
